                I always love to collect minimal and mordern 
                furniture for my home and specially for my 
                work place. Due to covid situation as I need 
                to work from home so now a days its 
                mandatory for me to think more creatively 
                within my work place. so, minimal colored 
                furniture will help me a lot in this case.

                Current app UI is messy. I think need to <br>
                improve the app user interface, So that all <br>
                information can be found organized and easy <br>
                to navigate. Also need to show the order <br>
                process in a mordern way.

                Problems will come up. Your willpower will run out. Like <br>
                mana or stamina, willpower is a finite resource. When your <br>
                own willpower runs out, you re in trouble. Your iron will <br>
                begin to crack. You ve without a doubt felt this before. <br>
                Maybe youve noticed its easier to avoid bad habits in the <br>
                morning. By the time you finish school , or work , or <br>
                whatever else you have going on during the day, junk food <br>
                is a lot harder to resist.
